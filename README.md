## What this is
A beginner-friendly full-stack starter to deploy a simple web app on GCP (Cloud Run), built in VS Code.

- backend/   (FastAPI - serves Hello World for now)

## Run locally (backend)

# (commands will be added in the next steps)

## Deploy (later)
We will deploy the backend to Cloud Run using gcloud.
